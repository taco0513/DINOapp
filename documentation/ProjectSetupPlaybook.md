## üöÄ Phase 1: Project Foundation

### Step 1.1: Project Initialization

```bash
# Create new Next.js project with TypeScript
npx create-next-app@latest project-name --typescript --tailwind --eslint --app

# Navigate to project directory
cd project-name

# Initialize git repository
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial project setup"
```

### Step 1.2: Essential Dependencies Setup

```bash
# Core dependencies (based on project needs)
npm install next-auth @next-auth/prisma-adapter @prisma/client prisma zod

# Development dependencies
npm install -D @types/node tsx

# Database setup (if using Prisma)
npx prisma init
```

### Step 1.3: Package.json Scripts Enhancement

Add these essential scripts to your package.json:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "next dev",
    "build": "next build",
    "start": "next start",
    "lint": "next lint",
    "type-check": "tsc --noEmit",
    "db:generate": "prisma generate",
    "db:migrate": "prisma migrate dev",
    "db:push": "prisma db push",
    "db:studio": "prisma studio",
    "db:seed": "tsx prisma/seed.ts"
  }
}
```

## üìä Phase 2: Requirements Analysis & Planning

### Step 2.1: Create Core Planning Documents

Create these essential documents in your project root:

**planning.md**

```markdown
# [Project Name] - Planning Document

## üåç Project Overview

[Brief description of the project]

## üéØ Core Goals

- [Goal 1]
- [Goal 2]
- [Goal 3]

## üë• Target Users

- [User group 1]
- [User group 2]

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### Tech Stack

- Frontend: Next.js + TypeScript
- Backend: Next.js API Routes
- Database: [Your choice]
- Authentication: NextAuth.js
- Styling: Tailwind CSS

## üìà Success Metrics

- [Metric 1]
- [Metric 2]
```

**tasks.md**

```markdown
# [Project Name] Development Tasks

## üöÄ High Priority - Epic 1: Foundation

- [ ] Project setup and infrastructure
- [ ] Authentication implementation
- [ ] Basic layout and navigation

## üèóÔ∏è High Priority - Epic 2: Core Features

- [ ] [Core feature 1]
- [ ] [Core feature 2]

[Continue with detailed task breakdown]
```

### Step 2.2: AI-Assisted Requirements Analysis

Use this AI command to analyze your planning documents:

```
Analyze the planning.md and tasks.md files to identify:
1. Core functional requirements
2. Non-functional requirements (performance, security, etc.)
3. Technical constraints and dependencies
4. Risk factors and mitigation strategies

Provide a structured analysis with priorities and recommendations.
```

---

## üîç Phase 3: Technical Architecture & API Planning

### Step 3.1: Third-Party API Analysis

**üéØ This is where our enhanced workflow comes in!**

Use this AI command at the **design phase** (not during implementation):

```
Analyze my codebase for any third-party APIs that are required or recommended (including in the PLANNING.md and TASKS.md files). Make a plan to use the Context7 MCP to search relevant documentation needed for each of these APIs. Then, plan to add relevant documentation to a md file in the /documentation folder of my project directory
```

### Step 3.2: Create Documentation Structure

```bash
# Create documentation folder
mkdir documentation

# This structure will be populated by the AI analysis
documentation/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ api-documentation.md     # Third-party APIs
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ architecture.md          # System architecture
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ deployment.md           # Deployment guide
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ development.md          # Development guidelines
```

### Step 3.3: System Architecture Design

Use this AI command:

```
Based on the requirements in planning.md and the identified APIs, create a comprehensive system architecture document that includes:
1. High-level system overview
2. Component interaction diagrams
3. Data flow architecture
4. Security considerations
5. Performance requirements
6. Scalability planning
```

## üèóÔ∏è Phase 4: Development Environment Setup

### Step 4.1: Environment Configuration

```bash
# Create environment files
touch .env.local .env.example

# Add to .env.example (template for team)
echo "NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-secret-here
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-google-client-id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-google-client-secret
DATABASE_URL=your-database-url" > .env.example

# Add .env.local to .gitignore (if not already there)
echo ".env.local" >> .gitignore
```

### Step 4.2: TypeScript Configuration

```json
// tsconfig.json enhancements
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "strict": true,
    "noUncheckedIndexedAccess": true,
    "paths": {
      "@/*": ["./src/*"],
      "@/components/*": ["./components/*"],
      "@/lib/*": ["./lib/*"],
      "@/types/*": ["./types/*"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 4.3: Project Structure Setup

```bash
# Create essential directories
mkdir -p lib/{auth,database,utils} components/{ui,forms,layout} types

# Create type definitions
touch types/global.ts types/api.ts types/auth.ts
```

---

## üß™ Phase 5: Testing & Quality Setup

### Step 5.1: Testing Framework Setup

```bash
# Install testing dependencies
npm install -D jest @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom
npm install -D @types/jest jest-environment-jsdom

# Create test configuration
touch jest.config.js jest.setup.js
```

### Step 5.2: Code Quality Tools

```bash
# Install additional linting tools
npm install -D @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin @typescript-eslint/parser

# Create or enhance ESLint config
# Add Prettier if needed
npm install -D prettier eslint-config-prettier
```

## üîÑ Workflow Optimization

### Lessons Learned Integration

Based on the DiNoCal project experience:

1. **API Documentation Early**: Don't wait until implementation to document third-party APIs
2. **Environment Setup First**: Complete development environment before starting implementation
3. **TypeScript Strict Mode**: Enable strict TypeScript from the beginning
4. **Testing Foundation**: Set up testing framework during project initialization
5. **Documentation as Code**: Keep documentation in version control and update regularly

### AI Assistance Best Practices

1. **Specific Commands**: Use detailed, specific prompts for better results
2. **Iterative Refinement**: Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable pieces
3. **Context Awareness**: Provide relevant context files and project information
4. **Quality Review**: Always review AI-generated code and documentation
5. **Knowledge Capture**: Document AI interaction patterns that work well

# ðŸš¨ URGENT SECURITY ACTION REQUIRED

## IMMEDIATE ACTION NEEDED

Your Google OAuth credentials were exposed on GitHub and **MUST BE ROTATED NOW**.

### Step 1: Rotate Google OAuth Credentials

1. **Visit Google Cloud Console**: https://console.cloud.google.com
2. **Navigate to your project** (likely named "DINOapp" or similar)
3. **Go to APIs & Services > Credentials**
4. **Find your OAuth 2.0 Client ID**
5. **Delete or regenerate the exposed client secret**
6. **Copy the new credentials**

### Step 2: Update .env.local

Replace these lines in your `.env.local` file:

```env
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID="your-new-google-client-id-here"
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET="your-new-google-client-secret-here"
```

With your actual new credentials from Google Console.

### Step 3: Test Application

Run `bun dev` to ensure authentication still works.

**CRITICAL**: The exposed credentials can be used by anyone to access your Google OAuth application. Complete this rotation immediately.

**Status**: âœ… NEXTAUTH_SECRET rotated | ðŸ”´ Google OAuth credentials still compromised
